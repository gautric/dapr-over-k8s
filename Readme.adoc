# DAPR over K8S

This project explains how to install DAPR over K8S with Ansible and Helm Chart solutions.

## DAPR Overview

Dapr is an amazing middleware framework. This framework helps developper to build and use resilient and secured microservices mainly over a Kubernetes infrastructurefootnote:[a local installation is possible : https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/self-hosted/]. Dapr for **D**istributed **Ap**plication **R**untime provide several piece for developers, integrators and operators who want run theirs application on a Kubernetes cluster. 
The main idea of Dapr is to wrap / abstract all tiers components whitin an standardized API.

### Building blocks

Dapr brings lot a cool stuff like : 

* Service-to-service invocation
** Service call mechanism
* State management
** A store system for long living data
* Publish and subscribe
** Pub/Sub solution over Kafka or another MoM solution
* Secrets
** Keep sensitive information into secret mechanism
* Configuration
** Manage properties/values/parameters

### API

Because Dapr abstracts all backend with an API, Dapr provides two kinds of API.

* *REST API*
** Buildings blocks are exposed with a REST API, applications can directly call components throught this

* *Code API*
** Depending application language, Dapr supply several code librairies to talk to the REST API inside the application.

## HELM 

Helm system is the package manager for all software or solution running over Kubernetes. Helm provides the same user experience as _yum_, _apt_ but focus on Kubernetes technologies.
As Kubernetes, Helm is YAML first. Developer can create some powerful template for his application or solution. When Operator needs to install the solution, Helm merge the Helm package with some specifics values (Env values, k8s cluster values, package values, Business values). 

## Ansible

Ansible is a automation tool world wide used. This tool helps IT Ops to automate all technical configuration and deployment over any infrastructures : OnPremise, Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, Edge etc....
By using playbook, a YAML file including all commands designer by Ansible, Ops users can control, deploy, check lots of devices/services/vm/cloud infrastructure. Ansible separates execution and configuration, it means that you can reuse any playbook with another environment configuration smoothly. 

## Let's run

To use this project you need at least :

* Openshift 4.10/Kubernetes
* Cluster admin
* Ansible 2.13+
* Helm 3.9+

What's the playbook does :

. Install Helm Chart Repo (DAPR and REDIS)
. Install DAPR Helm 
. Create a route to Dapr Dashboard
. Install Redis Helm 
. Apply Redis integration to DAPR
. Deploy NodeJS sample 
. Deploy Python sample

To run this playbook you need :

* Clone this repository 

  git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gautric/dapr-over-k8s.git

* Execute the playbook

  ansible-playbook dapr.yaml

* Check the final installation from 

  kubectl --namespace dapr-system  logs `kubectl --namespace dapr-system get pods -l app=node --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name"` node 

and 

  kubectl --namespace dapr-system  logs `kubectl --namespace dapr-system get pods -l app=python --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name"` python 

* Check DAPR Dashboard

  open -a Firefox   http://`kubectl --namespace dapr-system get Route -l app=dapr-dashboard --no-headers -o custom-columns=":spec.host" `

You should get this kind of output into your browser

### TODO

* Create Role
* Add new Application
* Add new Building blocks
